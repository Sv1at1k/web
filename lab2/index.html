      <article class = "Bio">
         <p>Chris Luera is one of the best street workout athletes in the world. He is also Battle of the Bars 3x Middleweight World Champion and WCO MasterTrainer.
            Chris got into fitness and street workout 4 years ago when he lost his mother. He started going to the gym to distract himself from the stress.
         </p>
         <p>“When I was a kid, I went through a lot of bad situations because of a lot of bad decisions that I made. When I was very young, I got wrapped up in drugs and gangs. So, when I was 11 years old, I went to jail for the first time. And from that point on, I was never able to step away from that criminal element in my life. I was in and out of jail from 11 to 23.</p>
         <p>I stepped away from my criminal life to live for my mom. I was trying to work stupid little jobs so that I could give her back all the efforts and love and everything that she gave to me, to try to better myself. So, that’s what I was living for. When I lost her, I completely fell apart. I didn’t care if I lived or died, I didn’t care about anything anymore, because my mom, whom I was living for, was gone.</p>
         <p>Somehow I found calisthenics. I ended up in the gym for some odd reason, I found these guys for some reason. And now, I’m doing this sport. And from the darkest point in my life, when I was falling apart and not wanting to live, I found something like… I didn’t want to go to sleep anymore. I was like, if I go to sleep now, maybe I could wake up earlier, and maybe I can get to traffic, and be at the beach, so that I could workout, and I can get that muscle up, maybe that backflip.</p>
         <p>There was something now that I was waking up and wanting to do something. I didn’t wake up and then want to go back to sleep. I didn’t wake up and like, ‘f.ck, I am awake’. I wake up and I say, ‘Yes, now I’ve got to do something, I’ve got to work out’. So, calisthenics and street workout and fitness, changed and saved my life.</p>
         <p>Now I am in the position that I can help somebody, who is asking me… And to see someone light up, after they got their first muscle, after they got the first hand stand. It might only be just that, a muscle up or a hand stand. But the next day they will go to work and tell all their friends that they did a muscle up. And they’re gonna be happy and proud of what they did, and they might get someone else to move.</p>
         <p>Or they might be struggling, something may be going on with their son or their daughter, mom or aunt. And that 20 minutes on the bar, struggling through, trying to get over it, and they finally get that muscle up, and they forget about whatever that might be f..ng up their head at that moment. That’s all what it’s all about. Stress will f..ng kill you men.. And if we can eliminate stress, for whatever amount of time that you can, that’s what it’s all about. Enjoying your life. I enjoy what I do. If you try, maybe you’ll enjoy it, too.”</p>
